# Progress 
Currently working on extracting the necessary info from ripgrep. 
I made a handmade parser for that, the parsing is done, and i want to visualize that as a tree because why not. 
So I stopped working on this project and I am currently working on the graph visualization for general trees. To do so I want to work with opengl, and i am in the process of learning the basics of it.

After finishing that i will work on the translation phase of my tool. I am still not sure to what format i need to change to translate to, a format that is easily used in vimscript.
